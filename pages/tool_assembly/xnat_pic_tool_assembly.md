## What is XNAT-PIC?

**XNAT for Preclinical Imaging Centers (XNAT-PIC)** consists of a set of tools to store, process and share preclinical imaging studies built on top of the [XNAT](https://www.xnat.org/) imaging informatics platform.


 
## Who is XNAT-PIC intended for?

Preclinical imaging centers deal with many challenges mostly related to the variety of imaging instrumentation yielding huge volumes of raw data. The current procedures to collect, share and reuse preclinical image data are insufficient, thus revealing an urgent need of standardization in terms of data storage and image processing. XNAT-PIC has been developed to overcome this limitation by extending XNAT’s basic functionalities to meet the needs of preclinical imaging facilities. 

## Which task can be solved with XNAT-PIC?

XNAT-PIC is a set of tools to support preclinical imaging scientists in their data management and processing needs. In particular, it consists of:

1. **MRI2DICOM**, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) converter from ParaVision® (Bruker, Inc. Billerica, MA) file format to DICOM standard

2. **XNAT-PIC Uploader** to import multimodal DICOM image datasets to XNAT

3. **XNAT-PIC Pipelines** for analysing single or multiple subjects within the same project in XNAT.
