## Introduction
The plant science domain aims at studying the adaptation of plants to their environment, with applications ranging from improving crop yield or resistance to environmental conditions, to managing forest ecossystems.

Data integration and reuse are imperative in this domain, as it relies on understanding the play between genotype and environment to produce a phenotype, and therefore requires integrating phenotyping experiments and genomic assays made on the same plant material, with geo-climatic data. Moreover, cross-species comparisons are often necessary to understand the mechanisms behind phenotypic traits, especially at the genotypic level, due to the gap in genomic knowledge between well-studied plant species (namely *Arabidopsis*) and newly sequenced ones. Yet, in few domains is data integration so challenging.

The challenges to data integration stem from the multiple levels of heterogeneity in this domain. It encompasses a variety of species, ranging from model organisms, to crop species, to wild plants such as forest trees. These often need to be detailed at infra-specific levels (e.g. subspecies, variety), but naming at these levels sometimes lacks consensus. Studies can take place in a diversity of settings including indoor (e.g. growth chamber, greenhouse) and outdoor settings (e.g. cultivated field, forest) which differ fundamentally on the requirements and manner of characterizing the environment. Phenotypic data can be collected manually or automatically (by sensors and drones), and be very diverse in nature, spanning physical measurements, the results of biochemical assays, and images. Thus the extension and depth of metadata required to describe a plant experiment in a FAIR-compliant way is very demanding for researchers.

Another particularity of this domain is the absence of central deposition databases for plant phenotyping data. Whereas datasets from plant omics experiments are typically deposited in global deposition databases for that type of experiment, those from phenotyping experiments remain in institutional or at best national repositories. This raises challenges to finding and accessing plant phenotyping data, as well as interconnecting all datasets produced in projects that encompass molecular studies and phenotyping experiments.


## Plant Phenotyping Metadata Management
 
### Description
To ensure compliance with the FAIR principles in plant phenotyping datasets, it is highly recommended that metadata collection is contemplated from the start of the experiment and that the working environment facilitates (meta)data collection, storage, and validation throughout the project, up to the publication.

Detailed metadata needs to be captured on a number of aspects. One of the most critical is the description of the biological materials used in the study—the plant varieties and, when applicable, the seed lots or the parent plants—as they are the key to integrating omics and phenotyping datasets. Particularly in field studies, it is equally critical to record the geographical coordinates and time of the experiment, for linkage with geo-climatic data. In growth chamber or greenhouse studies, the environmental conditions that were fixed should be described in detail.

### Considerations

* Is your plant material provided by a Genebank or derived from a material provided by a Genebank?
* Have you documented your phenotyping assays (trait, method, units) both for direct measures and computed data?
  * Is there an existing [Crop Ontology](https://www.cropontology.org) for the species you experiment and does it describe your assay?
* Do you have your own system to collect data and is it compliant with the [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/) standard?

### Solutions
* The metadata standard applicable to plant phenotyping experiments is [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/).
  * It contains a section dedicated to the identification of plant biological materials that follows the general standard for the identification of plant genetic resources, [The Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors](https://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/faobioversity-multi-crop-passport-descriptors-v21-mcpd-v21/).
  * It is also possible to describe samples that were collected from the experimented plants for specific phenotyping assays
  * For woody plants, particularly those in forest settings, it is common to use GPS coordinates as a unique identifier for plant material.
  * There is a section to describe the phenotyping assays based on the [Crop Ontology](https://www.cropontology.org) recommendations
  * There is section describing the experiment itself (greenhouse, field, etc...) and it is advisable to collect its geographical coordinates and time of experiment for linkage with geo-climatic data.

* Tools for data collection and management:
  * The [ISA-Tools](https://isa-tools.org/) also include a configuration for MIAPPE and can be used both for filling in metadata and for validating.
  * [SEEK](https://seek4science.org/) and [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) are free softwares that can be used for data management
  * [COPO](https://copo-project.org/) is a data management platform specific for the plant sciences
  * [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org) is a manually curated metadata registry of reporting guidelines, vocabularies, identifier scheme, models, formats, repositories, knowledgebases and data policies in the plant sciences and across domain.
  
* Validation of MIAPPE compliance can be done via [ISA-Tools](https://isa-tools.org/) or upon data deposition in a BrAPI-compliant repository ([Breeding API, BrAPI](https://brapi.org/).

* Data should be deposited into one of the many repositories that implement BrAPI, as this enables both validation and findability, through the [FAIDARE plant data discovery service](https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/).


## Plant Data Deposition
 
### Description
Finally you need to identify where to can deposit and publish the plant phenotyping data, given that there is no global centralized archives for that type of data.
You are managing your own repository of plant phenotyping data and you feed it from datasets produced in different collaborative projects. Some partners of these projects use their own data management platforms, while others collect data manually into excel spreadsheets. You want to ensure that the uptake of the data from your partners and its import in your repository is easy and includes a step of validation of the metadata upon intake.

### Considerations
* Are the datasets and databases MIAPPE compliant?
* With whom (individual researchers and/or data management platforms) and how (manual and/or automated) will you exchange data?

### Solutions
* For collaborators that collect data manually, you should define a spreadsheet template that is compatible with your database structure 
  * Your template should make use of tools for handling ontology annotations in a spreadsheet like for example [OntoMaton](https://github.com/ISA-tools/OntoMaton) 
  * If your database is MIAPPE compliant, you can use the [MIAPPE-compliant spreadsheet template](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE/raw/master/MIAPPE_Checklist-Data-Model-v1.1/MIAPPE_templates/MIAPPEv1.1_training_spreadsheet.xlsx)
* For collaborators that collect data in their own data management platforms:
  * If it implements [BrAPI](https://brapi.org/), you can ingest data using BrAPI calls
  * If it doesn’t implement BrAPI, they should export their data into the spreadsheet template you define for manual collection
* Data validation can be done via BrAPI

 
## Keep the connection between phenotyping and genomic data
 
### Description 
You have set up an experiment in which you are studying a panel of genetic resources in different conditions. You take various phenotyping measurements on the plants themselves and you collect samples at different development stages to perform transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis. You want to ensure that you keep the link between the plant material in the field, their phenotypes and the results obtained in transcriptomics and metabolomics in the datasets that will be generated and when possible published in international archives (transcriptome and metabolome data).

### Considerations
* The key informations for integrating phenotyping and genomic experiments are the identifiers of the different varieties/accessions that constitute the panel of genetic resources that are phenotyped and the identifiers of the samples that are collected from these varieties/accessions for transcriptome and metabolome analysis. these identifiers are generated by distinct groups of people: 
  * laboratories, genebanks or a governed regional network of genebanks like ECPGR or EUFGEN for accessions/varieties
  * international archives dedicated to the description of the samples associated to the genomic data deposited in the archives of the INSDC global consortium  
* Another handy feature is to give a permanent access to a project description that links to all the data and that makes is findable
  
### Solutions
* For phenotyping data, proceed as described in ## Producing FAIR plant phenotyping data
* For transcriptomic data
